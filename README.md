# Project 1
## [Covid19-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/Ahmed-Sheekhuna/Covid-Data-Exploration)
##### [Interactive Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidVisualisation_16693055520360/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

* The data-set analysed contains global covid-19 records from the first case up until march 2021 for every
country/region. 
* The steps taken to complete the project are: loading of data, data cleaning/pre-processing,
exploratory data analysis, analysing region based data, measuring statistical factors, predictive analysis
and visualisation using tableau.

# Project 2
## [Hotel-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/Ahmed-Sheekhuna/Hotel-Data-Analysis)
##### [PowerBI Dashboard](https://github.com/AhmedHamadiSheekhuna/Hotel-Data-Analysis/blob/main/hotel-project%20visual.pdf)
### Hotel booking data analysis using SQL and visualisation using PowerBI 
* For this project I explored Hotel data to answer the following important stake holder questions:
1. "Is our hotel revenue growing by year?" To answer this question I explored revenue of both types of hotels
2. "Should we increase our parking lot size?" 
 Here i explored if there is a trend in guests with personal cars to answer the question in hand
3. "What trends can we see in the data?" 
 Here i explored the trends in the average daily rate combined with the average daily guests
* Project Pipeline 
1. Build a database ->2. Data exploration with SQL ->3. Connect Power BI to the Database ->4. Visulaize Data

# Project 3 [Using python for data exploration and analysis](https://github.com/Ahmed-Sheekhuna/Python_EDA/blob/main/README.md)
* For this project i used python,s pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlip and datetime libraries for data exploration/analysis/visualisation of movie data.
* The purpose of this project is to provide answers for stake holders looking to get into the film making industry.
* Questions i will be exploring to paint a clearer picture for the stake holders:
1. When is the best time of the year to release a movie to gain maximum profits?
2. Which actors and directors to choose to maximise success of a movie?
3. Does the length of the movie and the rating have any impact on Net Profit, Profit Margins and IMDb ratings?
4. What type of movies are most profitable to produce and how much should you spend?
